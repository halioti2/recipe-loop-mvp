# Enhanced OAuth Token Management - Environment Setup

# Add these variables to your .env file for enhanced token refresh capabilities

# Google OAuth credentials (get these from Google Cloud Console > Credentials)
# These should be the SAME credentials you use in your Supabase Auth settings
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Example of how to get these credentials:
# 1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
# 2. Select your project (or create one)
# 3. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
# 4. Choose "Web application"
# 5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
#    - https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
#    - http://localhost:3000 (for development)
#    - https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app (for production)
# 6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

# Security Note:
# - Client secrets in frontend are not ideal for production
# - Consider implementing the backend refresh endpoint for maximum security
# - The enhanced AuthContext will gracefully fallback if these aren't set

# Optional: If you prefer backend-only token refresh (more secure)
# Uncomment and use these instead, and implement the backend endpoint
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com  
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Your existing Supabase environment variables (keep these)
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
